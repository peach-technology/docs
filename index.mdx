Huam is a synthetic dollar protocol that captures DEX liquidity provision yield through hedged, delta-neutral strategies—delivering sustainable returns from real onchain trading activity.

## Key Properties

| Attribute | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| **Profitability** | Access to DEX trading fees—one of the highest sustainable yield sources in DeFi, less prone to compression than funding rates |
| **Autonomousity** | No active position management required; protocol handles pool selection, rebalancing, and cross-chain deployment |
| **Risk Management** | Derivative hedges neutralize impermanent loss, targeting delta-neutral returns from fee income | 
| **Transparency** | All LP positions, hedge ratios, and P&L are verifiable onchain in real time |

## Core Components

The protocol operates through a dual-token system that cleanly separates stability from yield:

- **USDhm** is Huam's synthetic dollar—fully backed, mintable and redeemable 1:1 with USDC. Holding USDhm alone provides zero exposure to strategy performance. The peg holds regardless of whether the yield strategy gains or loses.

- **sUSDhm** is the yield-bearing token. Built on the ERC-4626 vault standard, sUSDhm appreciates against USDhm as yield accrues. Stake USDhm to receive sUSDhm; unstake to redeem for more USDhm than you deposited. All positions, hedges, and P&L are verifiable onchain.

This architecture ensures that users who want stability get stability, and users who want yield get yield—with no confusion between the two.

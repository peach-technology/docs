DEX liquidity provision is one of the most underexploited yield sources in crypto. Yet the vast majority of this yield remains uncaptured. Active management is demanding, impermanent loss is difficult to hedge, and opportunities are fragmented across dozens of DEXs, token pairs, and networks.

This creates a persistent market inefficiency: high yields exist because few can systematically harvest them. Huam exists to capture this.

Compared to other yield sources commonly used by stablecoin protocols, DEX LP fees sit in a different category:

- **Basis arbitrage**: Funding rates compress as capital enters; yields typically range 5-15% APR
- **RWA-backed stablecoins**: Constrained by off-chain interest rates at 4-8% APR

These strategies prioritize stability and precise delta neutrality. Huam takes a different approach: optimized yield with managed risk. The underlying source is trading activity itself, which means higher return potential but also requires active position management and hedging.

## Value Proposition

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **High Yield** | Access to DEX LP fees—among the highest sustainable yield sources in DeFi |
| **Automated Management** | No active position management required; protocol handles rebalancing across pools and exchanges |
| **Risk Management** | Hedged positions minimize exposure to volatility of underlying assets and impermanent loss of LP position |
| **Transparency** | All positions, P&L, and hedging activity verifiable onchain |

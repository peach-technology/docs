Yield-bearing stablecoins have demonstrated product-market fit, yet dominant yield sources are approaching structural limits. Huam introduces a different yield primitive by converting onchain trading activity—one of the most persistent drivers of value in crypto—into stablecoin-denominated returns.

## Landscape

Most yield-bearing stablecoins rely on one of two established approaches, each with inherent constraints:

**Funding rate based models** earn yield from perpetual futures funding dynamics. While effective during periods of sustained positive funding, returns compress as capital scales and can turn negative during risk-off environments when positioning shifts.

**RWA-backed models** pass through off-chain interest from treasuries or money markets. These yields are predictable but structurally capped by prevailing real-world interest rates.

Huam accesses a distinct segment of the yield landscape by deriving returns directly from DEX trading activity.

## Opportunity: DeFi’s Untapped Edge

DEX liquidity pools represent one of the most significant native revenue sources in DeFi. Trading fees are generated directly from transaction volume and market volatility, creating return potential that expands during periods of active market participation.

LP fee yields vary widely across pools and market regimes. During periods of elevated volatility and strong volume, return potential can materially exceed funding-based or RWA-based models.

Capital inflows into liquidity pools do not compress fee generation in the same linear manner as funding strategies. Greater liquidity can support deeper markets, larger trades, and sustained volume growth.

Liquidity provision carries structural risk. Impermanent loss caused by price divergence between assets can erode trading fee income, and without active risk controls, elevated gross APR may not translate into durable net returns.

## Solution: LP Yield, Simplified

Huam abstracts liquidity provision and hedge management into a single yield-bearing stablecoin structure.

Huam applies systematic hedging to manage directional exposure embedded in LP positions. The objective is not to eliminate risk entirely, but to moderate volatility and preserve fee income across market cycles.

Strategy execution, hedge adjustments, and capital allocation operate within predefined protocol logic. Holders gain exposure to LP-derived revenue without directly managing positions, rebalancing inventory, or timing exits.

Market environments affect performance differently. Lower-volatility regimes reduce hedging costs, while higher-volatility regimes typically increase trading volume and fee generation. The strategy framework is designed to operate across both conditions.

## Goal

Huam aims to make one of DeFi’s highest-return native yield sources accessible through a structured stablecoin framework.

By combining hedged liquidity provision, capital buffers, and collateral isolation, Huam offers an alternative to funding-dependent and rate-capped yield models while maintaining strict separation between stablecoin backing and strategy exposure.

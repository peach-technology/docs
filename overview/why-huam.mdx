Yield-bearing stablecoins have proven product-market fit, yet the sources of that yield are reaching structural limits. Huam introduces a new primitive for stablecoin yield by capturing the value generated by decentralized exchange (DEX) activity.

## The Opportunity

DEX liquidity pools represent one of the largest yield sources in DeFi. Active pairs routinely generate 20-50% APR in trading fees, yet this yield remains largely inaccessible to the average holder. 

DEX liquidity provision generates yield from trading volume—fees paid by users swapping tokens. Unlike speculative yield sources, LP fee income doesn't compress with capital inflows to the same degree. More liquidity enables larger trades and more volume, creating a more sustainable yield dynamic that scales with the growth of the ecosystem.

The problem has never been finding yield; active LP positions on pairs like ETH-USDC routinely generate high fees. The problem is *keeping* that yield. Impermanent loss—the nonlinear drag from price movements—can erase profits entirely.

## The Bottleneck: The "Passive LP" Trap

While 30%+ APR looks attractive on a DEX dashboard, most of that yield "leaks" away through Impermanent Loss (IL) for anyone who isn't actively managing their position. Profitable liquidity provision is currently a high-maintenance strategy requiring constant monitoring, quantitative risk management, and continuous delta-hedging.

This complexity creates a barrier. Most capital remains idle or settles for lower-yield alternatives because the "work" required to capture LP fees safely is too high for the average holder.

## The Huam Value Proposition

Huam solves this by abstracting the complexity of active liquidity management into a single, liquid stablecoin.

*   **Connecting to DeFi's GDP:** Huam connects stablecoin holders directly to the most fundamental source of revenue in crypto: **Trading Volume**. Unlike funding rates—which depend on market sentiment and "greed"—swap fees depend on activity. As long as people are trading, Huam is generating yield.
*   **"Hedging as a Service":** The protocol performs the heavy lifting of dynamic delta-hedging. By neutralizing the price exposure of LP positions, Huam transforms a high-risk, high-maintenance strategy into a "set-and-forget" yield source.
*   **Volatility as an Asset:** Instead of fearing market swings, Huam turns volatility into yield. High volatility typically leads to increased swap volume and higher fee generation, allowing Huam to remain resilient even when directional markets are sideways or uncertain.

## The Landscape: Beyond Existing Strategies

Most yield-bearing stablecoins rely on one of two established strategies, both of which face inherent constraints:

**Funding rate arbitrage** captures the spread between spot and perpetual futures prices. These strategies scaled quickly but funding rates compress as capital enters. Yields that once exceeded 20% APR now typically sit at 5-15%, and returns can flip negative during bear markets when longs pay shorts.

**RWA-backed yields** pass through off-chain interest from treasuries or money markets. These are stable and predictable, but structurally capped by real-world interest rates. When central bank rates are 4-5%, that is your ceiling.

Huam doesn't compete with these strategies—it complements them by accessing a different part of the yield landscape that is driven by volume rather than debt or speculation.

## The Goal

Our goal is to make the highest-performing yield source in DeFi as accessible as holding a dollar. By automating the protection layers and strategy execution, Huam provides a sustainable, volume-driven alternative to the existing yield landscape.

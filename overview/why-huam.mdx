Yield-bearing stablecoins have proven product-market fit, yet the sources of that yield are reaching structural limits. Huam introduces a new primitive for stablecoin yield by capturing the value generated by decentralized exchange (DEX) activity—the core "GDP" of the onchain economy.

## Landscape: The Yield Ceiling

Most yield-bearing stablecoins rely on one of two established strategies, both of which face inherent constraints:

**Funding rate arbitrage** (e.g., Ethena) captures the spread between spot and perpetual futures prices. While effective, funding rates compress as capital enters. Yields that once exceeded 20% APR now typically sit at 5-15%, and returns can flip negative during bear markets when sentiment turns.

**RWA-backed yields** (e.g., Ondo, Usual) pass through off-chain interest from treasuries or money markets. These are stable and predictable, but structurally capped by real-world interest rates. When central bank rates are 4-5%, that is your ceiling.

Huam accesses a different part of the yield landscape—one driven by volume and activity rather than debt or speculative sentiment.

## Opportunity: DeFi’s Untapped GDP

DEX liquidity pools represent one of the largest and most sustainable yield sources in DeFi. Active pairs routinely generate 20-50% APR in trading fees, yet this yield remains largely inaccessible to the average holder. 

Unlike funding rates, LP fee income doesn't compress with capital inflows to the same degree. More liquidity enables larger trades and more volume, creating a sustainable yield dynamic that scales with the growth of the ecosystem.

The problem has never been finding yield; the problem is *keeping* it. Impermanent loss—the nonlinear drag from price movements—often leaks profit back to the market, turning a high-APR position into a loss for anyone who isn't actively managing their position.

## Solution: Capture Without Complexity

Huam solves the "Passive LP Trap" by abstracting the complexity of active liquidity management into a single, liquid stablecoin.

*   **Connecting to Volume:** Huam connects stablecoin holders directly to trading volume. Unlike funding rates—which depend on market "greed"—swap fees depend on activity. As long as people are trading, Huam is generating yield.
*   **Automation & Protection:** The protocol performs the heavy lifting of dynamic delta-hedging. By neutralizing the price exposure of LP positions, Huam transforms a high-risk, high-maintenance strategy into a "set-and-forget" yield source.
*   **Volatility as an Asset:** Instead of fearing market swings, Huam turns volatility into yield. High volatility typically leads to increased swap volume and higher fee generation, allowing Huam to remain resilient even when directional markets are sideways or uncertain.

## Goal

Our goal is to make the highest-performing yield source in DeFi as accessible as holding a dollar. By automating the protection layers and strategy execution, Huam provides a sustainable, volume-driven alternative to the existing yield landscape.

# What is Huam

Huam turns DEX liquidity provision into a simple, yield-bearing stablecoin.

DEX LP positions offer some of the highest yields in DeFi, but capturing them is hard. It requires constant monitoring, active rebalancing, and sophisticated hedging to manage impermanent loss.

Huam does this for you. The protocol continuously scans pools across multiple DEXs and networks, selects the best opportunities, and manages fully hedged positions. The yield flows back to you, with all the complexity abstracted away.

## Core Components

- **USDhm**: A synthetic dollar, mintable and redeemable 1:1 with USDC.
- **sUSDhm**: A yield-bearing ERC-4626 token representing staked USDhm.

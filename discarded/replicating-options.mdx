The hedging approach described previously requires options with convex payoffs. In traditional markets, we would simply purchase these options from an exchange. In crypto, this is often not practical.

## The Options Market Problem

Crypto options markets are illiquid and limited to a handful of major assets—primarily BTC and ETH. Even for these assets, liquidity concentrates at specific strikes and expirations, with wide bid-ask spreads.

For token pairs like CRV-WETH, ARB-USDC, or other DeFi native assets, options markets simply don't exist. There is no venue where we could purchase the straddles needed to hedge these positions.

## Dynamic Replication

Rather than buying options directly, Huam **replicates** the desired option payoffs using perpetual futures. This technique, known as delta hedging or dynamic replication, is well-established in traditional finance.

The core insight: any option's payoff can be approximated by continuously adjusting a position in the underlying asset to match the option's **delta**—its sensitivity to price changes.

### How It Works

Using an option pricing model (such as Black-Scholes), we calculate the theoretical delta of a straddle at any given price and time. We then maintain a perpetual position sized to match this delta.

As price moves and time passes, the delta changes, and we rebalance the perpetual position accordingly:

| Price Movement | Straddle Delta | Perpetual Action |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| At entry (ATM) | Near zero | Small or no position |
| Price rises | Positive (call dominates) | Go long |
| Price falls | Negative (put dominates) | Go short |
| Near expiry | More extreme swings | More frequent rebalancing |

By continuously adjusting our perpetual position to track delta changes, we replicate the option's payoff without ever holding the actual option.

## Practical Considerations

Replication is not a perfect substitute for holding actual options. Several factors affect the quality of the hedge:

**Path Dependency**
The cost of replication depends on the realized path of price, not just the final outcome. Frequent large moves (high realized volatility) increase rebalancing costs.

**Discrete Rebalancing**
Perfect replication requires continuous adjustment. In practice, we rebalance at discrete intervals, introducing some tracking error.

**Transaction Costs**
Each rebalancing trade incurs fees and potentially slippage, which accumulate over the position's life.

**Model Risk**
Replication relies on theoretical option deltas. If model assumptions don't match reality, the hedge may be imperfect.

## When Replication Outperforms

Despite these limitations, replication using perpetuals is often more cost-effective than purchasing options—particularly when:

- Implied volatility is elevated relative to subsequent realized volatility
- Options markets are illiquid with wide spreads
- No options market exists for the asset pair

Replication also enables hedging on assets where no other solution exists, dramatically expanding the universe of viable LP opportunities.

## Alignment with LP Exposure

In practice, applying the option delta to our portfolio often results in a net position close to the LP's underlying token amounts. This provides intuitive alignment between the hedge and the exposure.

The replication approach allows Huam to apply sophisticated hedging strategies across the full spectrum of DeFi assets, not just the few with liquid options markets.

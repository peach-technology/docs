title: "Hedging Impermanent Loss"
description: "Using options to neutralize the nonlinear risk of LP positions"
---

The previous section established that impermanent loss has a convex, nonlinear profile that linear instruments cannot fully hedge. This section explains how options solve this problem.

## Why Options?

Options are financial instruments with built-in convexity. A call option gains value at an accelerating rate as price rises; a put option does the same as price falls. This curved payoff profile is exactly what we need to offset the curved loss profile of IL.

For a symmetric LP range, a **straddle**—buying both an at-the-money put and call—creates a payoff that mirrors impermanent loss. As price moves away from the strike in either direction, the straddle gains value, offsetting the IL incurred by the LP position.

## The Complete Hedge

Huam's hedging approach combines three components:

1. **LP Position**: Earns trading fees, exposed to IL
2. **Short Perpetual**: Removes directional (linear) exposure to price
3. **Straddle**: Offsets the convex IL profile

When combined, these three elements produce a portfolio with a flattened PnL across a wide range of prices. The position captures fee revenue while neutralizing both directional exposure and impermanent loss.

Unlike a portfolio with only a short hedge, this fully hedged position does not suffer losses when price moves toward the range boundaries. The straddle payoff compensates for the IL that the linear short cannot cover.

## Selecting Option Maturity

Options have expiration dates, which introduces a question: how long should the option last?

The answer depends on how long the LP position is expected to remain in range. If price exits the range, the LP stops earning fees and must be repositioned.

Assuming price follows a random walk, we can estimate the expected time to reach a boundary. For a return level $r$ (the distance to the range boundary), the expected time is:

$$
T = \frac{[\ln(1+r)]^2}{\sigma^2}
$$

where $\sigma$ is annualized volatility.

**Example**: ETH volatility = 60%, price range = ±20%

$$
T = \frac{[\ln(1.2)]^2}{0.6^2} \approx 0.092 \text{ years} \approx 34 \text{ days}
$$

We match the option tenor to this expected duration. Tighter ranges mean shorter-dated options; wider ranges allow longer tenors.

## The Profitability Condition

With hedging costs quantified, profitability becomes a straightforward comparison:

$$
\text{Fee APR} + \text{Funding Income} > \text{Hedge Cost APR}
$$

If fee revenue plus any funding payments from the short perpetual exceed the cost of the options hedge, the position is profitable.

This framework shifts the evaluation from "which pool has the highest APY?" to "which pool has the best risk-adjusted return after hedging costs?"

## What Hedging Achieves

Adding options doesn't magically create yield. If a pool's fee revenue is insufficient relative to its volatility, hedging simply reshapes risk without improving economics. The option premium reflects the true cost of the volatility exposure.

However, the framework provides two significant benefits:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Variance Reduction** | Returns become consistent across different price paths, rather than highly profitable in some scenarios and deeply unprofitable in others |
| **Rigorous Evaluation** | Options pricing provides a sound theoretical basis for comparing opportunities, replacing naive APY comparisons with true risk-adjusted analysis |

The next section explains how Huam implements this hedging approach when liquid options markets don't exist.

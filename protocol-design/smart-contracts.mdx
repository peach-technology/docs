Huam implements a modular "Hub-and-Spoke" architecture that separates core protocol functions from cross-chain strategy execution. This design secures the stablecoin ledger on a single network while enabling capital deployment across multiple chains.

## System Overview

| Domain | Location | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Contracts (Hub)** | Main Network (Base) | User deposits, stablecoin accounting, yield distribution |
| **Strategy Contracts (Spokes)** | Multiple EVM chains | LP position management, hedging, fee collection |

## Core Contracts

Core contracts manage the protocol's ledger and all user-facing interactions. They are deployed on the main network and control the issuance of USDhm and sUSDhm.

### Minter

The gateway for USDhm issuance and redemption.

- **Collateral Custody**: Holds USDC backing all *unstaked* USDhm. This capital is never deployed to strategies.
- **Issuance**: Mints USDhm 1:1 against USDC deposits.
- **Redemption**: Burns USDhm to return USDC to users (minus 0.1% fee).

### Staking Vault

The interface for earning yield, implementing the ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard.

- **Share Accounting**: Issues sUSDhm representing a user's proportional claim on the yield-generating portfolio.
- **Fund Routing**: Routes staked USDC to the Strategy layer via the Collector.
- **Yield Accrual**: Receives rewards from the Reward Manager, increasing the sUSDhm exchange rate over time.

### Reward Manager

The central buffer between raw protocol earnings and user distributions.

- **Revenue Aggregation**: Collects yield bridged back from Strategy Contracts across all chains.
- **Smoothed Distribution**: Streams rewards to the Staking Vault at a controlled rate to reduce APY volatility.
- **First-Loss Buffer**: Absorbs short-term losses before they affect staker principal. See [Protection Layers](/protocol-architecture/protection-layers).

## Strategy Contracts

Strategy contracts handle capital deployment and position management. They are deployed on each chain where the protocol operates.

### Collector

The satellite treasury on each chain.

- **Capital Routing**: Receives funds from Core and allocates to Adaptors based on target weights.
- **Cross-Chain Bridging**: Manages movement of principal (outbound) and revenue (inbound) between chains.
- **NAV Reporting**: Aggregates position values from all connected Adaptors to report total deployment value.

### Adaptors

Specialized connectors for external DeFi protocols.

- **Protocol Integration**: Each Adaptor interfaces with a specific DEX (Uniswap V3, Aerodrome, etc.).
- **Position Management**: Mints, holds, and manages LP NFTs or position tokens.
- **Standardized Interface**: Executes atomic commands (Deposit, Withdraw, Collect) from the Collector.

Adaptors are intentionally minimal—they contain no business logic, only execution. This isolation limits the blast radius of any single integration failure.

## Contract Addresses

See [Contract Addresses](/resources/contract-addresses) for deployed contract addresses across all networks.

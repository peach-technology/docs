description: "Overview of the protocol's smart contract design"
---

The protocol is deployed across a main network of the protocol and multiple EVM chains where LP opportunities exist.

## Main Network

| Contract | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Minter** | Handles mint/redeem of USDhm against USDC collateral. Transfers collateral to Collector when USDhm is staked. |
| **Staking Vault** | ERC-4626 vault for USDhm → sUSDhm conversion. Receives yield from Reward Manager. |
| **Reward Manager** | Buffers incoming yield, controls distribution velocity, absorbs short-term losses. |

## Per-Chain Deployment

| Contract | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Collector** | Holds deployed assets. Routes funds to LP positions and exchange margin accounts. Handles cross-chain bridging and swaps. |
| **Adaptors** | DEX-specific interfaces (e.g., Uniswap V3 Adaptor, Aerodrome Slipstream Adaptor). Each holds LP position NFTs and executes position management. Only callable by Collector. |

This modular design allows Huam to deploy to any EVM-compatible network and integrate with any concentrated liquidity DEX without modifying core protocol contracts.

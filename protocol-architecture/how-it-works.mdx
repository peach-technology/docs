# How does Huam Work

![How Huam Works](/images/image.png)

The movement of funds through Huam follows a defined path:

1. **Deposit**: User mints USDhm with USDC. Collateral held in Minter contract.
2. **Stake**: User deposits USDhm into the Staking Vault, receiving sUSDhm. The corresponding USDC collateral transfers from Minter to Collector.
3. **Deployment**: Collector allocates funds between:
    - DEX LP positions (via Adaptors)
    - Exchange margin accounts (for hedging)
4. **Yield Collection**: Revenue from LP fees and funding payments flows to the Reward Manager.
5. **Distribution**: Reward Manager releases yield to the Staking Vault, increasing the sUSDhm exchange rate.

Unstaked USDhm remains fully backed by USDC in the Minter contract, ensuring immediate 1:1 redemption availability.

Withdrawal from the vault takes reverse of above process. Collector sends corresponding collateral(USDC) to sUSDhm contract, and then directed to Minter contract again when user claims the withdrawal request.

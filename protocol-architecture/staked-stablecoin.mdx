# Staked USDhm (sUSDhm)

## Staking

Users deposit USDhm into the Staking Vault and receive sUSDhm based on the current exchange rate. No minimum deposit. Yield accrues automatically—no claiming or compounding required.

## Unstaking

A 7-day lockup applies to all staked positions. After initiating unstake, users wait 7 days before claiming their USDhm. This lockup:

- Prevents sudden capital flight during market stress
- Allows the protocol to unwind positions in an orderly manner
- Protects remaining stakers from forced liquidations at unfavorable prices

After the lockup period, users can claim USDhm at any time. Redemption to USDC is always available without delay.

## Reward Distribution

- target APY = (current collateralization ratio - desired collateralization ratio) * reward distribution interval / 365
- actual APY = last distribution APY * smoothing factor + target APY * (1 - smoothing factor)

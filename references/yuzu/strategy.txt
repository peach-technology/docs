# Underlying Strategies

**Principles & Mandate**

Yuzu Money’s strategies are:

* **100% on-chain and verifiable** via [Accountable](https://yuzu.accountable.capital/)
* **Bound by the** [**Asset Whitelist**](https://app.yuzu.money/asset-whitelist)&#x20;
* **Risk-first** – Prioritizing capital preservation over yield
* Backed by a layered protection stack (yzPP first-loss tranche, Nexus Mutual insurance where applicable, and the Reserve Fund)

This page explains the main *strategy families* that backing assets are deployed into. For a live view of exposures, refer to the Strategy Breakdown section of our [Transparency](https://yuzu.accountable.capital/) dashboard.

**Strategy Buckets**

At a high level, backing strategies include but are not limited to:

* DeFi liquidity provision
* Leveraged loops&#x20;
* Private TVL programs
* Pre-deposit vaults
* Airdrop / points farming

The strategies are broadly categorized into the following buckets.

***

**1. Leverage Loops**&#x20;

> **Leveraged loops** on correlated assets, particularly where oracles are robust (e.g. hard-coded bands, long TWAPs, or fundamental backing).
>
> Examples include:
>
> * **USDe / stables loops**
> * **syrupUSDC /** **stables loops**
>
> The goal is to earn a spread between supply and borrow yields (plus incentives) while staying within LTV and liquidation thresholds.

***

**2. Private TVL Deals**

> Yuzu Money partners directly with protocols in **private TVL programs**.
>
> * These deals often come with improved economics (higher base yield, upside sharing, or bespoke incentives) in exchange for committed TVL.
> * All such deals are backed by whitelisted collateral and venues and must pass the same risk assessment as public strategies.

***

**3. Pre-Deposit Vaults**

> Ecosystems and/or protocols may offer **pre-deposit programs** where yield is boosted for early committed capital before a strategy is fully live.
>
> * Yuzu Money may allocate to such pre-deposit vaults when the underlying strategy, protocol, and asset risks have been reviewed and whitelisted.

***

**4. Airdrop / Points & Incentive Farming**

> Backing assets may be deployed into strategies that earn **airdrop / points / incentive rewards** from emerging protocols.
>
> * These strategies must still be **fundamentally sound** on an asset backing basis; with their points / airdrops / incentives treated with conservative estimates.
> * Any realized tokens or incentives from such programs accrue back to the protocol’s economic engine and Reserve Fund.

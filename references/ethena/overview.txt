# Ethena Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Ethena's USDe is **not** the same as a fiat stablecoin like USDC or USDT. USDe is a synthetic dollar, backed with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions.

This means that the risks implicated by interacting with USDe are inherently different.&#x20;

Please refer to our extensive [Risk](https://docs.ethena.fi/solution-overview/risks)[s](https://docs.ethena.fi/solution-overview/risks) section for more information.

## Overview

Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native solution for money, *USDe*, alongside a globally accessible dollar savings asset, *sUSDe*.\
\
Ethena's synthetic dollar, *USDe*, provides the crypto-native, scalable solution for money achieved by delta-hedging Bitcoin, Ethereum and other governance-approved spot assets using perpetual and deliverable futures contracts, as well as holding liquid stables such as USDC and USDT.&#x20;

*USDe* is fully-backed (subject to the discussion in the Risks section regarding events potentially resulting in loss of backing) and free to compose throughout CeFi & DeFi.

*USDe* peg stability is supported through the use of delta hedging derivatives positions against  protocol-held backing assets, maintaining a relatively stable value with reference to the value spot crypto assets as well as futures positions.&#x20;

The inclusion of liquid stables (such as USDC and USDT) enhances the efficiency of the delta hedging process, while also potentially acting as a safeguard in bear markets when funding rates and futures basis are suboptimal. Liquid stables may earn rewards depending on where they are held, potentially enhancing overall protocol revenue.

sNUSD
Earning Yield
Neutrl distributes generated yield exclusively to sNUSD holders. Users stake NUSD tokens through the staking contract to receive sNUSD, which represents their proportional share of the yield-bearing vault. The sNUSD token automatically appreciates in value as yield accrues, enabling passive yield earning without requiring any manual actions from users.

Unstaking process
Upon unstaking, sNUSD tokens are burned and users receive their proportional share of NUSD based on the current exchange rate. The protocol enforces a 10-day cooldown period before withdrawals can be executed.

The cooldown period ensures that there is enough time to unwind the collateral to meet the redemption

Yield Accrual Mechanism
Staking NUSD
Users deposit NUSD into the staking contract
The contract mints sNUSD based on the current sNUSD
exchange rate
Initial exchange rate: 1 sNUSD = 1 NUSD
The exchange rate increases over time as yield accumulates
Yield Distribution
Protocol generates yield through market-neutral strategies and revenue-generating activities
Yield continuously flows into the staking contract, increasing total NUSD reserves
Each sNUSD token appreciates proportionally as the vault grows
Passive Growth
Yield accrual requires no user intervention
Returns are automatically reflected in the increasing sNUSD redemption value
Calculation & Example

sNUSD:NUSD ratio = total sNUSD supply / (total NUSD staked + total protocol revenue deposited in NUSD terms)
Time period	sNUSD supply	Protocol revenue (NUSD)	sNUSD : NUSD ratio	sNUSD Received for 1 NUSD Staked	NUSD Received for 1 sNUSD Burned
Day 0	5,000,000	0	1	1	1
Day 90	5,000,000	250,000	1.05	0.95	1.05
Day 180	5,000,000	500,000	1.1	0.9	1.1
Day 270	5,000,000	750,000	1.15	0.87	1.15
Day 365	5,000,000	1,000,000	1.2	0.833	1.2

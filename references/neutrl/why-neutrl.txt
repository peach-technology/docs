Why Neutrl?
Neutrl transforms the ordinary synthetic dollar into the most efficient wealth-preservation asset in crypto.
Traditional onchain dollars slowly erode your purchasing power; by contrast, Neutrl gives it steady growth by unlocking access to yield typically reserved for hedge funds, OTC desks, and high-net-worth wallets.

The problem
Institutional-grade yield is gated
The most lucrative opportunities - carry trades, basis spreads, and funding-rate arbitrage - are locked behind the gates of OTC desks and prime brokers. These require millions of dollars in capital, established relationships, and costly legal expertise.

Public stablecoins keep the profits
Leading stablecoins like USDC, USDT, and their clones earn on their collateral but pass little to nothing back to holders. Your dollar stays stagnant while the issuer reaps the rewards.

DIY yield strategies are fragile
Retail yield farms are unreliable - often spiking briefly before decaying. Managing these strategies is a full-time job with many risks, including smart-contract failures, volatile returns, and systemic implosions.

Our answer
Neutrl simplifies the playbook for wealth generation in crypto. We combine three institutional-grade strategies - liquid basis trades, onchain cash-equivalent rates, and arbitrage opportunities - into a single, cohesive protocol. This protocol matches durations efficiently, channels yield directly to holders, and requires no active management.

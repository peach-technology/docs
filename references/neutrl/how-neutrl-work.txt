NUSD Issuance & Redemption
Deposit collateral
Eligible assets: USDC, USDT, USDe
Any time you deposit one of these tokens to the Router Contract, the system settles your deposit onchain.
Receive the receipt token
The router mints NUSD 1 : 1 against your collateral and returns it to your wallet in the same transaction.
Institutional custody & deployment
Collateral routes to segregated vaults at institutional custodians (Fireblocks, Copper, Ceffu etc.).
From there it is deployed into delta-neutral, duration-matched strategies that power the protocol's yield engine.
Unmatched liquidity
NUSD is an ERC20, with plug-and-play across CEX margin accounts, DeFi money-markets and onchain primitives.
Fast redemptions plus full backing make it “blue-chip” collateral wherever dollars are needed.
Staking NUSD → sNUSD
Stake
Stake your NUSD into the Staking Contract to convert it into sNUSD.
Earn the Neutrl rate
All protocol income - basis arbitrage, OTC carry, onchain reference yield pools - flows to the yield pool.
Every epoch the pool re-indexes sNUSD balances upward
Unstake at any time and you receive NUSD + accrued yield, subject to the 10-day cooldown period.

Locking NUSD / sNUSD / LP tokens
Choose a lock tenor
Lock assets for 6 to 12 months inside the Locking Contract.
Boost your rewards
Longer locks earn higher points → a larger slice of future emissions & incentive campaigns.
Future-proof distribution
The protocol may evolve to a weighted-average maturity model, seamlessly routing more yield toward longer-dated lockers to keep duration perfectly balanced.
